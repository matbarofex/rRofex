With this package, you will be able to execute API calls to the 'Matba Rofex' trading platform. 

The main functionalites include:accessing account data and current holdings, retrieving investment quotes, placing and canceling orders, and getting reference data for instruments.

You can find the complete documentation under https://apihub.primary.com.ar/

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# To install the package you just need to use the command:
install.packages("rRofex")

# Then load it with
library(rRofex)
```

#### Development version

You can use the development version to try new features or bug fixes directly from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# 1. In R install the package `devtools`.
install.packages("devtools")

# 2. Once `devtools` is installed, install `rRofex`
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("matbarofex/rRofex")

# 3. Then load it with
library(rRofex)
```

## References

At the present we provide two libraries for ingesting data from Matba Rofex:

- **rRofex**: methods for trading. 
- [acyRsa](https://github.com/matbarofex/acyrsa): methods for accessing Back Office data from ACyRSA


### Summary of actions for trading

These are the currently available actions within the library:

- Authentication 
- Reference data request
- Real-time and historical market data request
- Orders placement
- Orders management
- Account information request
- Websocket methods

### Environments:

- *Demo Environment*: go to [reMarkets](https://remarkets.primary.ventures/) to get free credentials. 
- *Production*: for credentials please contact: <mpi@primary.com.ar> for more information. 
- *Production - xOMS*: please contact your broker for credentials.

### Connection Protocols

There are currently three standard protocols that are being used to connecting to the market::

1. **REST**. Inside this library most methods use this protocol internaly. 
2. **Websocket**. The methods have the suffix 'ws' inside it's name.
3. *FIX*. We don't have any short term plans to develop this wrapper.

## Examples

### 1. Authentication

There are different environment on which one can connect to. 

For **paper trading** exists [reMarkets](https://remarkets.primary.ventures/). If you go there, you will be able to get free credentials to start trading with a demo account.

If you already have a **live trading** account with a broker, you should ask them what kind of *order management system* (OMS) do they use. If they have the suite of **Primary**, then you will have to ask them for the *user*, *password* and *base_url*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Using `trading_login()` you will be able to connect. 
# You will need to use this object in each request made. You can have multiple connections simultaneously.
conn <- trading_login(username = XXX, 
                      password = XXX, 
                      base_url ='https://api.remarkets.primary.com.ar')

# The connection is valid only for the day, you can get your log in information with `login_date_time()`
login_date_time(conn)
```

### 2. Reference Data

There are many types of request that you can make in order to get reference data. The basic one is to ask for a detailed list of every listed instrument.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# You can get a complete Reference Data list with details
trading_instruments(connection = conn, 
                    request = "securities", 
                    sec_detailed = T)

# If you are interested only in the front month of each contract of features, you can try
trading_instruments_fronts(connection = conn)

# If you only want equities
trading_instruments(connection = conn, 
                    request = "by_type", 
                    sec_type = "E")
```

### 3. Market Data

You can access real time market data and historical market data. There is a version with Websocket being developed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Real Time Prices using the REST protocol
trading_md(connection = conn, 
           symbol = "DODic20")

# Historical Trades
trading_mdh(connection = conn, 
            symbol = "DOJul20", 
            date_from = "2020-02-06", 
            date_to = "2020-03-06")
```

### 4. Order Placement

With the method `trading_new_order()` you will be able to trade on the market. The basic order type is as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trading_new_order(connection = conn, 
                  account = "XXX", 
                  symbol = "DOEne21", 
                  side = "Buy", 
                  quantity = 10, 
                  price = 92.14)
```

### 5. Order Management

If you want to know the status of your arder, you will need ths method:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trading_orders(connection = conn, 
               account = "XXX")
```

### 6. Account Information

With `trading_account()` and `trading_account_report()` you will be able to obtain information about your current position in terms of instruments and in terms of cash and settlement dates.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# With trading account you can get the information about your basket
trading_account(connection = conn, 
                account = "XXX")

# With trading account report you can have your cash, margins, etc.
trading_account_report(connection = conn, 
                       account = "XXX")
```
### 7. Websocket Methods

Instead of requesting information using REST protocol, you could get it through Websocket. This means, that you can listen to an object and be notified every time that a change has been made.

The methods available in Websocket protool are:

- Listen to Market Data with `trading_ws_md()`
- Listen to Order status with `trading_ws_orders()`
- Close Websocket connections with `trading_ws_close()`
